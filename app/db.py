# Event lifecycle:
#   queued     - waiting for the first attempt or a retry
#   processing - an HTTP attempt is in flight (at most one per endpoint)
#   delivered  - got a 2xx response (terminal)
#   dead       - all attempts of the current round exhausted (dead-letter);
#                terminal unless replayed, which starts a fresh backoff round
#   expired    - still queued when its ``expires_at`` deadline was reached
#                (terminal); never receives an attempt and stops blocking
#                its endpoint so the next event can proceed. Events already
#                in ``processing`` are never interrupted by their deadline.
TERMINAL_STATUSES = ("delivered", "dead", "expired")

# Per-target circuit-breaker lifecycle:
#   closed    - deliveries proceed; ``consecutive_failures`` counts the
#               current run of failed attempts and resets to 0 on any 2xx
#   open      - the target failed BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD times in a row;
#               no event for the target may be claimed until
#               ``open_until``. Other targets are unaffected
#   half-open - ``open_until`` has elapsed; exactly one event (the due head
#               event) has been claimed as a probe and is in flight. While
#               it runs, nothing else for the target is claimable
# A 2xx probe closes the breaker; any other outcome reopens it for another
# full open window. All breaker state lives in the ``breakers`` table, so a
# restart keeps the deadline counting instead of resetting it.


# Per-target maintenance pause:
#   A row exists only for targets explicitly configured via PUT
#   /targets/pause. ``paused=1`` gates scheduling: no *new* event for the
#   target may be claimed (claim_due_events LEFT JOINs this table in its
#   single claim transaction), while an event already ``processing`` is left
#   untouched and its in-flight request completes normally. Pause never
#   resets attempt counts, backoff or breaker state; queued events still
#   cross their ``expires_at`` deadline and are swept to ``expired`` while a
#   target is paused. Setting the same flag repeatedly is idempotent. State
#   lives only in SQLite, so it survives restarts and is initialised on old
#   databases by ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``.

    One transaction, three steps:

    1. Every ``queued`` event whose ``expires_at`` has passed is flipped to
       ``expired``. It never receives an attempt and stops blocking its
       endpoint, so the next event for the same target can proceed. Events
       already ``processing`` are deliberately not touched — an in-flight
       attempt is never interrupted by its deadline.
    2. An event is claimable only when it is ``queued``, its backoff and
       ``deliver_after`` (both folded into ``next_attempt_at``) have
       elapsed, and no earlier (lower rowid = earlier creation) event for
       the same target is still ``queued``/``processing``. Claimed events
       flip to ``processing`` so another tick can never double-claim them.
       This is the ordering guarantee: a later event cannot be picked while
       an earlier one is pending — even if that earlier event is merely
       waiting for its ``deliver_after`` — in flight, or backing off.
    3. The per-target breaker gates step 2: while it is ``open`` nothing for
       that target is claimable until ``open_until`` elapses; while it is
       ``half-open`` a probe is already in flight, so nothing else goes.
       Once an open deadline has elapsed, the single due head event is
       claimed and the breaker atomically flips to ``half-open`` with that
       event recorded as its probe. Different targets stay independent, so
       a breaker on one endpoint never blocks anyone else.
    4. A target under maintenance pause (``target_pauses.paused = 1``) gates
       step 2 exactly like the breaker: nothing new for it is claimable and
       other targets are unaffected. Events already ``processing`` are not
       touched, so an in-flight request always completes. The gate and the
       claim run in this one transaction under ``db_lock``, which is the same
       lock the pause write takes, so a committed pause is visible to the
       very next claim and a claim that committed first is never rolled
       back. The expiry sweep in step 1 deliberately ignores the pause.
